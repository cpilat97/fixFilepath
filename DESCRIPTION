Description: The idea of this package is fairly simple, as it really  only does
             one thing: fix a windows file path when you copy it. If you have worked with windows at all and you go to copy a file path 
             from file explorer and paste it into your r script, you\'ve encountered
             the problem of it having a single forward slash (\\). Well....in R, this 
             is an escape charater and causes issues for you. So what do you have to 
             do? Either go through and add an additional forward slash to escape it 
             (ie change C:\users to C:\\users), or change the forward slash to a 
             backslash. Either way, it's some manual filepath manipulation that causes
             pains. So this package changes those to a single backslash (/) so you can always
             recopy the filepath and plug it back into your file explorer (if you've
             tried to put that doubleslash in there....it fails).
